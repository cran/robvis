\title{Produce traffic-light plots of risk-of-bias assessments.}
\usage{
rob_traffic_light(data, tool, colour = "cochrane", psize = 20,
  quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing summary (domain) level risk-of-bias assessments, with the first column containing the study details, the second column containing the first domain of your assessments, and the final column containing a weight to assign to each study. The function assumes that the data includes a column for overall risk-of-bias. For example, a ROB2.0 dataset would have 8 columns (1 for study details, 5 for domain level judgments, 1 for overall judgements, and 1 for weights, in that order).}

\item{tool}{The risk of bias assessment tool used. RoB2.0 (tool='ROB2'), ROBINS-I (tool='ROBINS-I'), and QUADAS-2 (tool='QUADAS-2') are currently supported.}

\item{colour}{An argument to specify the colour scheme for the plot. Default is 'cochrane' which used the ubiquitous Cochrane colours, while a preset option for a colour-blind friendly palette is also available (colour = 'colourblind').}

\item{psize}{Control the size of the traffic lights. Default is 20.}

\item{quiet}{An option to quietly produce the plot without displaying it.}
}
\value{
Risk-of-bias assessment traffic light plot (ggplot2 object)
}
\description{
A function to take a summary table of risk of bias assessments and produce a traffic light plot from it.
